# bash script

# How do I get my data in the BayeScan format?

# Use Stacks to generate a STRUCTURE file
# Import the STRUCTURE file using cyberduck/filezilla.
# DO NOT OPEN THE FILE!!!
# In finder, rename the file to whatever.txt
#Â In textedit, remove the file header
# Use PDG spider to convert into the correct format. This can take a while (for test data #2 it took over half an hour)

#!/bin/bash
#PBS -l walltime=6:00:00
#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=8
# i swear i can never get this to work via script
